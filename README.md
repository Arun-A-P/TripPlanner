# TripPlanner

Trip Planner is an Alexa skill which helps the user plan trips in his locality anytime and anywhere. The project gives a small
solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem we encounter in planning these trips. The project uses Python and the Google Places
API and Four Square API for finding the best places in the neighbourhood.
